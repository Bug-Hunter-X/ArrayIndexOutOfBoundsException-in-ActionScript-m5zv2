This repository contains an example of an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in ActionScript and its solution. The bug occurs when trying to access an array element with an index that is out of bounds. This is a common error in ActionScript, and this example demonstrates how to prevent it by checking the index before accessing the array element.  The solution adds a simple check to ensure the index is within the valid range of the array before accessing it.
